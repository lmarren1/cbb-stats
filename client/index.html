    <h1>Introducing Play Theory</h1>
    <p>A full-stack performance analytics platform built <i>exclusively</i> for Illini Menâ€™s Basketball</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding the specific combination of players and plays to pit against opponents is <i>the</i> age-old problem in basketball coaching.
    </p>
    <p>
        Classic basketball analytics place too much emphasis on abstract boxscore-derived statistics to solve this issue.
        Such analyses lack the depth necessary to capture more than just the 'what' that occurs underneath play-heavy, fast-paced college basketball.
    </p>
    <p>Inspired by modern approaches, I built <i>Play Theory</i> to uncover why certain players, lineups, and plays succeed against specific opponents.</p>
    <p>I believe coaches, staff members, and players may find my software particularly helpful for improving play-calling, scouting, and individual/team development.</p>

    <h2>Your New Analytics Solution</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Championships are <strong>not</strong> built on box-scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            They're painstakingly fought for every posession, during every play-call, by each player on the floor.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <i>Play Theory</i> breaks down games using <i>SideArm Sports</i> play-by-play data and compiles it back into actionable, interactive insights on player, lineup, and play performance for coaches and players alike.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p><i>Play Theory</i> integrates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An efficient PostgreSQL database</li>
        <li>An asynchronous Node.js backend</li>
        <li>And customizable Plotly.js frontend visuals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>all wrapped in a lightning-fast, modern web interface.</p>
